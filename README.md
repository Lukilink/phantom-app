# Phantom
Control your car's steering and movement from an app with openpilot. Designed to be a gimmick feature more than anything. It's a mock Tesla Summon.

Safety is solely your responsibility. You must remain vigilant in the rare event of malfunction. However, there is now disconnection detection so that the car should stop moving in the event that the app no longer sends commands to openpilot.

Download the app [here](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/phantom-app/blob/master/phantom-app.apk?raw=true).
