Control your car's steering and movement from an app with openpilot. Designed to be a gimmick feature more than anything. It's a mock Tesla Summon.

Safety is your responsibility, however a key safety feature to be added will be disconnection detection so that your car should stop moving the second it stops receiving commands from your phone in the event of a disconnect.
